            <p >The only way to build a complex kit is to do one part at a time, and constantly test that previous parts still work. That is to say, if the VCO is failing, the <strong>first</strong> thing to do is to check that the power supply still works. However, that means you'll need to know how to test if things work! </p>
            <p ><strong>Testing continuity:</strong> Often times you may want to check if you soldered something correctly. A guaranteed method is using the continuity checker on your multimeter. Very simply: if the meter beeps, then that means the two parts of the board you are probing are shorted together. Always test that its in the right mode by touching the tips together to verify that its beeping. This can also be used to test that things <em>aren't</em> connected. For example, power (ie the power supply outputs) and ground should <strong>never</strong> be continuous. When testing continuity on something like the +5.333V supply and ground, there will be a very short beep (due to the capacitor charging) and then silence. </p>
            <p ><strong>Testing voltages:</strong> You will need a multimeter (preferably digital, although analog ones are also very useful at times) or an oscilloscope. To test a DC voltage using a meter, set it to VDC mode (see the manual) and place the tip of the black probe at the negative side of the voltage (which, unless explicitly noted otherwise, is almost always 'ground') and the red probe at the positive voltage to test. To figure out where 'ground' is (or anywhere you want to test), refer to the schematic. A nice place I used during building is <strong>R179</strong>, on the I/O board (also, pin 2 of <strong>J4</strong>). In general, if its a gigantic swatch of copper, as opposed to a thinner trace, its a 'ground plane.' </p>
            <p ><strong>Applying voltages:</strong> There are also times when one needs to 'apply voltage' (usually low DC) to parts of the circuit. For example, testing the VCO requires applying a 1V/Octave voltage. A nice benchtop supply is best, or even a $20 kit. If you're really in a pinch, and you're not doing any fine tuning, remember that you can always use just batteries. (Of coures, they're not precise.) <strong>Always</strong> measure the voltage before applying it, just in case. Unless otherwise mentioned, all voltages are referenced positively to ground just like above.</p>

<!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Header" -->Placing 
            Components <!-- InstanceEndEditable -->
</div>

<div class="textblock">
<!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="text" --> 
            
              <p>There are 500 components in the x0xb0x (almost 100 10K resistors!) 
                of 100 different types. The most important part of assembly is 
                to keep the parts in order and solder them in the right place.                </p>
              <p>The 2 PCBs are silkscreened with part images and part names (although <em>not</em> part values). Each part name is unique, and can be 
                  cross referenced with the BOM below or in each section. In the 
                  more crowded sections there may be many part names and images 
                  and it might not be immediately obvious which part is which. However, 
                  each part name is adjacent to the picture. Therefore, look carefully 
                  to determine which part name goes with which image. </p>
              <p>It may help 
                    to place all the parts first, verify that they are all used and 
                    then solder them in place. You can also refer to the schematic.                    </p>
              <p>Remember that all resistors are named <strong>Rn</strong> (where 
                      n is some number), all capacitors are <strong>Cn</strong>, all 
                      transistors are <strong>Qn</strong>, all diodes are <strong>Dn</strong>, 
                      all LEDs are <strong>LEDn</strong>, all ICs are <strong>ICn</strong>, 
                      all switches are <strong>Sn</strong>, all large potentiometers 
                      are <strong>VRn</strong>, all trim potentiometers are <strong>TMn</strong>, 
                      all crystals/ceramic resonators are <strong>XTALn</strong>, and 
                      all jumper wires/cables are <strong>Jn</strong>. Parts should 
                      be placed over their picture and soldered on the other side. </p>
              <p>All 
                        the large potentiometers, switches, and LEDs are on the side that 
                        faces out. The rest of the components are placed on the opposite 
              side.</p>
              <ul>
              <li><strong>Resistors</strong><br>
                Almost all of the resistors are plain metal film 5% 1/4W type, 
                cylindrical and tan with 3 color bands and one gold band. To identify 
                the value, match the color bands to the BOM picture. Included 
                are also a few 1% 1/4W type which are blue and have 4 color bands. 
                There are also 2 PTC temperature sensitive resistors. They look 
                <strong>a lot </strong> like the 1% resistors so don't mix these 
                up! Resistors are non-polar: you can solder them any way you want. 
                You can also check the value using a multimeter; if you're not 
                experienced with decoding resistor color codes then this isnt 
                a bad idea at all.</li>
              <li><strong>Capacitors</strong><br>
                There are four types of capacitors: electrolytic, tantalum, ceramic 
                and polyester. Electrolytics are cylindrical, blue or black and 
                have a  stripe indicating the <strong>negative</strong> polarity. 
                They are polar: if you put them in backward they can explode, 
                which is very unpleasant. The PCBs have a marking for the <strong>positive</strong> 
                pin. Their value is written on the side (ie 10uF). The two 'dipped 
                tantalum' capacitors are yellow and blob-shaped, they are also polar, but have a marking for the 
                <strong>positive</strong> pin. The other two capacitors are non-polar. 
                The polyester (green, larger) and ceramic (yellow, smaller) capacitors shouldnt be mixed. Their value 
                may be written in 'exponential' notation so match the marking 
                with the picture we provide. In general, the drawing on the PCB 
                should match the size shape of the capacitor.</li>
              <li><strong>Diodes</strong><br>
                There are two kinds of diodes included: 1N4148 switching (red 
                glass with black stripe) and 1N4001 power (black epoxy with white 
                stripe). Both are polar, and will not function properly if put 
                in backwards. The arrow in the drawing 'points' to the stripe 
                on the casing. The 1N4001 are used on the power supply. All others 
                are 1N4148.</li>
              <li><strong>LEDs</strong><br>
                There are multiple LEDs &amp; they are all the same type. You 
                may want to change the color to suit your taste, just use any 
                bright 5mm LED. The LEDs are polar and wont work if put in backwards. 
                The flat side in the picture matches the flat side of the LED. 
              </li>
              <li><strong>Transistors</strong><br>
                There are multiple transistors used in different packages. The 
                analog section has two types of 5 pin matched transistors and 
                three types of 3 pin transistors.There is no difference in the 
                picture between the two 5 pin transistors so be sure to match 
                the part numbers right. All of the 2SC536Fs are drawn as empty 
                hemispheres, the 2SA733Ps have an extra line, the 2SK30s are filled 
                in. The transistors should not be put in backwards: the matched 
                pairs have slanted sides. The other transistors have flat/round 
                sides.</li>
              <li><strong>ICs</strong><br>
                There are many different ICs used. ICs must not be placed in backwards. 
                For DIP (dual in line) the notched end in the picture should match 
                the notched (or indented) end of the chip. For SIP (single inline, 
                as in the LA4140 and BA6110) the rounded end in the picture matches 
                the notched/indented end of the chip. They must also be soldered 
                more gently than the rest as overheating can damage the internals: 
                use the proper temperature and dont let the iron press against 
                the pins for more than a few seconds each. The EEPROM and microcontroller 
                come with sockets as you may want to replace them at some point. 
                If you feel nervous about soldering the other chips, you can socket 
                them too: any electronics store will carry the sockets for around $.50 each. Be sure to match the notch of the socket with the picture 
                so that you dont put in the chip in backwards some time later. 
                All the chips are clearly labeled on their top.</li>
              <li><strong>Potentiometers &amp; Trim Pots</strong><br>
                There are a bunch of different potentiometers, make sure to match 
                the numbers right. The label <strong>10KB</strong> means 10K linear 
                and <strong>50KA</strong> and <strong>50KD </strong>mean 50K log. All the trim pots look 
                alike so check the markings too. Solder these quickly because they made of plastic and can melt! </li>
              <li><strong>Plugs, connectors, switches, etc.</strong><br>
                Because these parts take a lot of physical stress, it is important 
                that they are soldered well. Make sure that there is enough solder 
                to fill the pad and make a nice strong connection.</li>

<div class="textblock">
<!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="text" -->
<p>99.5% of the time, the PCB is perfect. But if it isn't, it can be a total nightmare! PCBs are tested at the factory and are visually inspected. <strong>Still</strong> it is highly suggested that you spend 10 minutes looking over the PCB for any issues. </p>
<p>These are two PCBs with problems, luckily found before they were shipped to kitmakers like yourself! You can click to zoom in. The first one has a splash of copper which is shorting out the microcontroller lines! The second has a 'rotted' trace, that is both shorted to ground and open. No good! If you find a problem, you should contact support@adafruit.com to get a replacement (or you can try and fix it yourself using an exacto blade and some wire.) </p>
<p>One good way to get a nice look at the traces is to hold the PCB up with a bright (60W+) light behind it. </p>
