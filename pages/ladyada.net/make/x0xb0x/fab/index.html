            <p align="justify">Congratulations, you are the proud new owner of 
              a box of electronic components. With a bit of effort you can transform 
              these parts into a x0xb0x. By following these instructions, we think 
              you'll be able to get your kit together with a minimum of suffering.

            <p align="justify">There is absolutely zero guaranteed tech support with this 
              project. We cant guarantee any response to requests for help.  
              Instead, this manual is intended to be as close to a step-by-step 
              tutorial as possible. Also, it is in your best interest to be cautious 
              and sober when assembling this kit as a mistake can make the synth 
              sound wrong or not work well or perhaps not work at all.</p>

            <p align="justify">It is highly unlikely that replacement parts will 
              be available in case something goes wrong. However, the <a href="parts.html">BOM</a> 
              (bill of materials) is available, and you can easily order your 
              own replacement parts for common items from any <a href="../../../library/procure/index.html">reputable 
              electronics supplier</a>. There is also a list of 'odd transistor' 
              suppliers on the<a href="../resc.html"> resources</a> page where 
              you may be able to locate replacement parts. Of course, if your kit arrived with parts missing you should contact us immediately!</p>

            <p>Corrections and comments on the assembly manual are very much appreciated 
              by us and others. We want to make the manual easy to read and straightforward 
              to follow so that everyone is happy with their kit and none go to 
              waste. If <em>anything</em> in this manual is confusing, overly 
              difficult or just plain wrong, please post a message in the forums</p>
