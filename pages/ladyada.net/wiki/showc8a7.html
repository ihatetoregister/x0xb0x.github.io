It&#039;s hard to go wrong with free. Parts manufacturers are often more than happy to ship you, for no cost, a few samples of their merchandise. They often ship within the week, sometimes the next day, and with free 2-3 day FedEx/UPS.\n\

Self-described &quot;largest&quot; manufacturer of MCUs in the world allows small qty sampling of their MCUs - right on the top page.  Just ordered a R5F562N8BDFP.  Apparently they only allow Qty 1 of 1 part, but with free overnight shipping the gross inefficiency of this setup is on them and not you.  They just got back to me.  My order of one hour ago has already shipped, UPS 1 day with a tracking number.  Can&#039;t argue with free, fast, and professional, even if it is for one $9 part.\n\
</p>\n\
\n\
<p>\n\
Did another order with them, they are now offering up to 3 on 1 part.  Took three R5F562N8BDFB this time (same controller, 144 pins instead of 100).\n\

 I submitted a sample request through the Bourns website. A few days later I was contacted on the phone by a rep. The rep told me he &quot;wanted to make sure I was an engineer and not just some poor college student.&quot; - this was with regards to an order for two $0.60 parts. Then he kept insisting I meet him in person to &#039;discuss the project&#039;. You have been warned. -johngineer</div></blockquote>\n\

 Not quite a sample, but still free, I have acquired entire shopping bags full of disposable camera shells from local supermarkets with photolabs (HyVee, etc)  (Wal-Mart was very unhelpfull. I was told by someone in the photolab they resell the shells for 2$ to some company.)  Inside the shell you&#039;ll find a bunch of small plastic gears and parts (handy) the odd spring, a PCB containing: a nice 300v cap, a xenon flashbulb, and other nice parts, and 1 AA Battery, usually pretty well fully charged.  Out of one bag containing 30 cameras, I only had two dead batteries.  - spindizy</div></blockquote>\n\
